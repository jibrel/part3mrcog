Dear Dr,  
Re: Ms Bola Akintunde

I will be grateful if you would be kind enough to see Ms Bola Akintunde, a 33-year-old staff nurse in her second pregnancy, for counselling about the mode of delivery. She had her first child 3 years ago in London and sustained a fourth-degree perineal tear. She would like to review her options for this pregnancy.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr Hasan Ghassan MBBS, MRCP

You have 10 minutes in which you should:

- Take a focused history
- Counsel the patient
- Answer any questions she may have
