You are the Specialist Trainee 5 on call on the delivery suite. You have just arrived for handover at 0830.

Attached, you will find a brief resume of the eight women on the delivery suite, as shown on the board.

The staff who are available today are as follows â€“ an obstetrics ST1 (Specialist Trainee 1) in her fourth month of GP training, a fifth-year Specialist Anaesthetic Trainee and a consultant on call, who is not yet available on the unit.

**Six midwives:** MD in charge; BK, ON & NN can suture episiotomies; AR, PK & LM can insert IV lines; and MW is a midwife in the Alongside Midwifery Unit.

You have 10 minutes to study the board carefully and decide and discuss with the examiner what tasks need to be done, in which order they should be done and who should be allocated to each task.
