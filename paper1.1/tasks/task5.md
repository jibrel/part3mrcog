Dear Dr,  
I would be grateful if you could see Mrs. Kitty Simonds, a 30-year-old housewife, who had a ventouse delivery 6 weeks ago for failure to progress in the second stage. She saw the midwife at the surgery today and complained of dribbling urine and not feeling any sensation to void. When I examined her, I found a mass in the lower abdomen.

Her infant is doing very well, and she is breastfeeding.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. James Scraft MBBS, MRCGP, DCH
