London Road  
Windfield, WB1 5TU  

Dear Dr,  
Re: Deborah Stone

I would be grateful if you could see Mrs. Deborah Stone, who is 37 years old and is currently about 10 weeks pregnant. The reason for referring her to you rather than sending her to the midwife is because of her medical problems. She was diagnosed with diabetes 7 years ago and has been on metformin since then. She is currently on 1 g twice a day, but the control has been poor. This was an unplanned pregnancy.

This is her second pregnancy – the first was 8 years ago, and that was uncomplicated. She has a daughter who is otherwise healthy.

She does not have any other medical or surgical problems although she has problems with her weight. Her BMI is 36 kg/m².  
She smokes 10–15 cigarettes per day.

I placed her on folic acid 400 µg and have advised that she continues with this until she is 12 weeks.  
I have done a full blood count, and the results are attached.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. John Fothergill MBChB, MRCP, DRCOG

You have 10 minutes in which you should:

- Take relevant clinical history
- Counsel the patient about the implications of her diabetes on pregnancy and vice versa
- Outline the management of her pregnancy
- Answer any questions that she may ask
