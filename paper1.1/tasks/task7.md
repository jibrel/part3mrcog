Dear Mr Staycliffe,  
Re: Miss Yvonne Sutherland aged 18 years

I would be grateful if you could see this 18-year-old who came to see me with her caregiver requesting contraception. She has learning disabilities, and the caregiver was very insistent that I prescribe contraception for her. I did not feel competent to deal with this and hope that you would be able to provide appropriate advice and recommendation.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr Claire Thorpe MBBS, MRCGP, DRCOG

You have 10 minutes in which you should:

- Take a focused history
- Discuss her contraceptive needs
- Answer any questions that may arise from the consultation
