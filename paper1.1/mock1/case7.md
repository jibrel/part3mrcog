# Examiner’s Instructions

Familiarise yourself with the candidate’s instructions and use the questions below to structure a discussion on the management of the patient. You should guide the candidate with respect to time management.

1. What information will you seek prior to initiating discussions on contraception?
2. What would be the basis for offering contraception to this patient?
3. What steps will you take to ensure that you are able to offer contraception to her?
4. What options will you consider?

### A good candidate should cover the following:

#### What information will you seek prior to initiating a discussion on contraception?

- What is the learning disability, and what is the severity of this? Who is in the position of *locus parentis* (parent or relative or another person – e.g., parent and foster carer)?
- Establish a level of understanding by the patient (capacity).
- Why the request for contraception – from herself or caregiver?
- Is she in a relationship, has been in one before, or has the potential to be in one?
- Menstrual cycle including LMP.
- Sexual history – sexually active in a relationship? Any previous pregnancies?
- Previous contraceptive use.
- Current medication and allergy.
- Medical and surgical history, especially related to contraindications.
- Examination – weight, assess the level of understanding, and check BP.

#### What would be the basis for offering contraception?

- There is an obvious indication – it should be in the interest of the patient.
- To regulate menstrual problems or prevent unwanted pregnancies.
- If her health is at risk or if she gets pregnant.
- If she is at risk of STIs as well as unwanted pregnancy.

#### What steps will you take to ensure that you are able to offer her contraception?

- Ascertain ability to consent and ensure compliance with the Mental Capacity Act, which states that "doctors have a legal duty to consult a range of people when determining the best interest of a person who lacks capacity."
- If not, seek legal support for decision/refer for assessment of mental ability to consent (e.g., by a psychiatrist).
- Refer to a senior colleague and possibly a Family Planning consultant.
- Multidisciplinary team (physician, GP, social worker, and carer including Mental Health Team).

#### What options will you consider?

- Explanation of the types of contraception and complications to both the patient and the mother (caregiver).
- Choice will depend on the ability to comply – LARC most suitable.
- Choice has to be determined by several factors from her history, including her level of disability (ease of administration and ability to remember – compliance and side effects).
- LARC – best option – levonorgestrel (if period problems), subdermal implants, or copper IUD.
- Depot preparation needs three monthly injections and may not be easy to administer.
