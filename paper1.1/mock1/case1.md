### Simulated Patient's Information

You are Ms Samantha Scriven, 45 years old, and work as a nurse assistant in the geriatrics ward of the hospital. You have been working there for the past 10 years. You live on your own and smoke 15 cigarettes per day and drink alcohol regularly but never have more than a glass of wine a day.

You have a boyfriend who lives in his own house.

Over the last 1 year, you have had problems with your ‘waterworks’. You wet yourself every time you cough or sneeze. When it started, you thought it was associated with the change, but it’s got worse. You now have to wear a sanitary towel before you go out. You can no longer go to your aerobic classes because you are scared someone will smell the wee. You tend to go more often now than before, mainly for fear of wetting yourself when you cough. You do not wake up at night to pass urine, and when you feel like going, you do not have to rush to avoid an accident (wetting yourself). The only time you wet yourself is when you cough, sneeze or jump. You drink about four cups of coffee daily – usually one in the morning and then three others when you have a break at work. You drink diet coke but no energy drinks. When you pass urine, there is no burning sensation. You do not have any dragging sensation below, and there is no vaginal discharge. You do not suffer from constipation or diarrhoea.

You have had three normal vaginal deliveries. The first was 20 years ago. It was a normal pregnancy, and your labour lasted for 12 hours. The baby weighed 2,890 g. Your second was 2 years later, and again the pregnancy was problem free. He weighed 3,600 g at birth, and your labour lasted 8 hours. The third was problematic as you had diabetes during pregnancy and delivered 2 weeks early. She weighed 4 kg, and it was a forceps delivery as she did not want to come out. You had a bad tear, which was repaired without problems.

You have yearly tests for diabetes, and so far you are fine. You do not suffer from any other medical problems and have had no surgery in the past. You have, however, been experiencing hot flushes and night sweats for the last 18 months. You are not on HRT though. You are not taking any medications and have no known allergies.

You are overweight and have been unsuccessfully struggling to lose weight.  
You are very worried about the embarrassment this is causing you.

**If not discussed, you should ask the following questions:**

- What is wrong with me?
- How will you investigate my problem?
- What treatment will I receive? What if I do not want surgery? Will the surgery guarantee a cure, and will there be a chance of recurrence?
- What are the risks of surgery?
- Is this because of my weight. I am a bit on the big side with a BMI of 36 kg/M²?
