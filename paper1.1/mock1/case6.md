# Tips for the Candidate at This Station

1. Do not read the information for each room aloud to the examiner.
2. Where the action is urgent, if the consultant is around, it should be either yourself or the consultant.
3. For each room, think thoroughly and logically – history, examination, investigations (including CTG and FBS), and the decision of delivery.
4. Cannulation for high-risk women (e.g., VBAC, grand multipara, obese, twins, previous PPH, polyhydramnios, and anemia, for CS).
5. Doctor to see – is either the junior trainee, yourself, or the consultant.
6. Inform the pediatrician if meconium, preterm, or abnormal CTG or emergency CS occurs.
7. Prepare the patient for CS; this is the responsibility of the midwife.
