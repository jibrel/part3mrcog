### Simulated Patientâ€™s Instructions

You are Mary McNoughton, aged 37 years. You are requesting fertility treatment as a single parent. You married when you were 30 and always wanted at least two children. You conceived within six months of trying with your first pregnancy, but then tragically your husband was killed in a road traffic accident while you were still pregnant, so he never saw his son. You went on to have a normal vaginal delivery and now live with your two-year-old son, Luke. You have no financial problems.

You remain very sad about the loss of your husband but realise that life must go on. In particular, you do not want Luke to be an only child. You and your husband were both from large families; you remain close to both families and meet regularly. 

You also have a close circle of friends, including male friends, but realise that your chance of finding a new partner to share life with Luke and yourself is remote and this is not what you want to do. Family and friends are supportive of your desire for another child.

Your general practitioner has suggested donor insemination as a means of conceiving.

You are otherwise fit and well. Your periods started when you were 12 and your cycle has always been reasonably regular, varying from 28 to about 31 days. The only time you have been in hospital was to have your baby.

If not covered by the candidate, you could ask the following questions:

- What are my chances of being accepted for treatment?
- What are my chances of having a child?
- Who will be the legal father?
- What tests will I need?
- Is there a problem finding donors?
- Do I have any alternatives?
