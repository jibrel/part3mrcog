Dear Gynaecologist,

Re: Mary McNoughton – 40 Regent’s Park, London.

I would be most grateful if you could please see this 37-year-old woman who is requesting donor insemination fertility treatment as a single parent. She has a tragic history. Her husband was killed in a road traffic accident while she was pregnant and she now lives with her two-year-old son. She makes the point that she would not wish her son to grow up as an only child and that her chances of meeting a new partner in her situation are remote.

She is otherwise fit and well. I have checked her progesterone levels and your laboratory have reported them as ovulatory.

Thank you for your help.

Yours sincerely

A. Mohammed

Dr Ahmed Mohammed FRCGP
