## Candidate Instructions

This station is a role-play station and will assess your abilities to counsel Mrs. Anne Holmes, a 28-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with subfertility. Mrs. Holmes attended the infertility outpatient clinic 3 months ago, and baseline infertility investigations were organised for her as she had been trying to conceive with her partner for the past 24 months without success. She has a history of irregular periods for the past 5 years.

Biochemical female fertility investigations, her pelvic ultrasound report, and her husband’s semen analysis have confirmed polycystic ovarian syndrome as the only cause of her subfertility. Her BMI is 27.

You will be assessed using the following domains:

- Patient safety
- Communication with patients and their relatives
- Information gathering
- Applied clinical knowledge

You will have 10 minutes to address Mrs. Holmes’ concerns, explain the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome, and discuss potential treatment options for her.
