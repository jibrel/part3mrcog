### Instructions for Role Players

Please see clinical assessment task 16.2 'Instructions for the role players' for background.

- You were upset to learn at your last consultation that your ovaries were not working properly. You do not understand what being a Turner mosaic means and want the doctor to explain this to you. You have never heard of this condition before.

- You have looked up premature menopause on the internet and know that you could use donor eggs via an IVF process to get pregnant. You want to know if you can do this as you are still very keen to start a familyâ€”although you are beginning to despair about this.
