# Teaching Information

A good candidate will cover the following (note that the details here will not necessarily be covered in 10 minutes, but it is important to know them and the sequence in which they occur so as to apply appropriately):

### A. Introduction and state role

- **Introduction** – e.g. Hello Dr. Z I am Dr. XY, an ST5 who will be teaching you how to conduct a forceps delivery.
- **Establish** what the trainee knows and any previous experience with instrumental delivery.

### B. State the objectives of the teaching session

By the end of this session, you would be able to:

a. Identify the indications for assisting/expediting vaginal delivery.  
b. Understand the conditions that have to be fulfilled before conducting an operative vaginal delivery.  
c. Perform an operative vaginal delivery (ventouse/forceps, depending on which one you are teaching).  
d. Recognise and manage complications that arise from the procedure.  
e. Understand how operative vaginal deliveries are classified.

### C. The indications for an instrumental delivery include:

- Presumed fetal compromise in the second stage of labour.
- Shortening and reducing the effects of the second stage of labour on medical conditions (e.g., cardiac disease Class III or IV, hypertensive crises, myasthenia gravis, spinal cord injury patients at risk of autonomic dysreflexia and proliferative retinopathy).
- Inadequate progress – in nulliparous women – lack of continuing progress for 3 hours (total of active and passive second-stage labour with regional anaesthesia) or 2 hours without regional anaesthesia; in multiparous women – lack of continuing progress for 2 hours (total of active and passive second-stage labour with regional anaesthesia) or 1 hour without regional anaesthesia. Maternal fatigue/exhaustion.

### D. Brief overview of the instrument

- **Shows** the trainee the instrument and its parts.
- **Forceps** – blades (with two curves – pelvic and cephalic), shanks, handle, and locks.
- If it’s a ventouse, briefly explain the instrument.

### E. Classification of operative vaginal delivery

- **Outlet** – Fetal scalp visible without separating the labia; fetal skull has reached the pelvic floor. Sagittal suture is in the anteroposterior diameter or right or left occiput anterior or posterior position (rotation does not exceed 45°). Fetal head is at or on the perineum.
- **Mid** – Fetal head is no more than 1/5th palpable per abdomen, and the leading point of the skull is above station plus 2 cm but not above the ischial spines; two subdivisions:
  1. Rotation of 45° or less from an occipitoposterior position.
  2. Rotation of more than 45° including from an occipitoposterior position.
- Note that **High** operative vaginal delivery, where the head is 2/5th or more palpable abdominally and the presenting part is above the level of the ischial spines, is not advisable.

### F. Conditions to be fulfilled (prerequisites) for operative vaginal delivery

- Head is ≤ 1/5th palpable per abdomen.
- Vaginal examination – vertex presentation.
- Cervix is fully dilated and membranes ruptured.
- The exact position of the head can be determined so proper placement of the instrument can be achieved.
- Caput and moulding are assessed.
- The pelvis is deemed adequate.
- Irreducible moulding may indicate cephalo-pelvic disproportion.
- Adequate analgesia.

### G. Preparation of mother

- A clear explanation should be given and informed consent obtained.
- Appropriate analgesia is in place for mid-cavity rotational deliveries; regional block is preferable but pudendal block may be appropriate, particularly in the context of urgent delivery.
- Maternal bladder emptied. Indwelling catheter should be removed or balloon deflated.
- Aseptic technique.

### H. Application of the instruments

**Forceps**

1. First, assemble instruments on the trolley to ensure that they fit snugly.
2. Dismantle and take the right blade with your left hand (this sequence can be reversed).
3. Lubricate the blade with an appropriate lubricant.
4. Place your right hand inside the vagina and insert the blade holding it with the left hand between the hand and the fetal head. Gently push the instrument into position.
5. Repeat the above with the next blade (holding it with your right hand and with the left hand in the vagina).
6. Lock blades and ensure that there is not too much pressure in doing so (they should lock with ease) and check for their correct placement and safety (e.g., the sagittal suture is in the midline, the blades are equidistant from the sagittal and occipital sutures and you should be able to insert a fingertip between the fenestrations and the fetal head).
7. Gently apply traction to assess the fit and anticipated degree of force required and also chances of success.
8. Await contraction and ask the woman to push and at the same time gently pull – the direction of pull (usually downwards and forwards – following the axis of Carus or pelvic curve) will depend on the station of the presenting part. Stop pulling between contractions.
9. When the head is crowning, ask the woman to stop pushing.
10. Just before delivering the head, determine if an episiotomy is needed, and, if so, give one.
11. Once the head is delivered, dismantle the forceps and conduct the rest of the second stage having administered syntocinon with the delivery of the anterior shoulder.
12. Examine perineum and cervix for tears after the delivery of the placenta.
13. Make sure paired blood samples are obtained for cord pH and lactate.
14. Abandon the procedure if after three pulls the baby is not delivered and call your senior.

**Ventouse – if it requires a suction pump**

1. Check that the pressure pump is working.
2. Select the correct size cup.
3. Connect to the suction machine.
4. Lubricate the cup.
5. Apply the cup to the posterior vertex and check to make sure that it does not include the vagina.
6. Increase pressure initially to 0.2 kg/M² and then check to make sure the cup is not catching vagina.
7. Increase pressure to 0.8 kg/M² and then await contractions.
8. With each contraction, ask the woman to push and, at the same time, pull (direction of pull depends on the station and whether it’s a rotation or not).
9. Once crowned, either administer an episiotomy, if needed, or continue pulling until delivery of the head.
10. Once the head is delivered, disconnect the pump, dismount the cup, and conduct the rest of the second stage having administered syntocinon with the delivery of the anterior shoulder.
11. Examine the perineum and the cervix for tears after the delivery of the placenta.
12. Make sure paired samples are obtained for cord pH and lactate.

**Ventouse – Kiwi cup**

- Principles are the same except you will increase to the various colour levels.
- Green and orange, then once delivery is complete, deflate and remove.
