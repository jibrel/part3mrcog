## Simulated Patient Instructions

You are Kayleigh Madden, a 28-year-old nurse who has been trying for a baby for the past 3 years. You are married to Rob, who is unable to attend the clinic appointment with you today as he is at work as a chef. You were initially referred by your GP 3 months ago to the fertility clinic.

When you are told that Rob has had an abnormal semen analysis, you are shocked. You become upset and tearful that you may not be able to have children. You need to be reassured that there are treatments available that will allow you to become pregnant before you stop being upset. After this, you would like to know more about the ICSI treatment that has been suggested.

If not covered by the candidate, questions that you could ask include the following:

- What is the possible cause for why Rob has low sperm concentration?
- Is there anything that Rob can do to improve his sperm count?
- Would it have made any difference if we were referred earlier by the GP?
- Can you tell me what happens in ICSI treatment?
- Roughly, how successful is ICSI treatment?
- How much will the ICSI treatment cost?
- What will happen now?
