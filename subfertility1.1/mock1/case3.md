### Instructions for Assessor

Please read instructions to the candidate and actor.

- Allow the candidate to conduct the interview undisturbed unless they are straying off the track of the question (in which case you can show them their instructions again).
  
  This patient has tubal subfertility; the consultation should cover:
  
  - Laparoscopy
  - Previous surgery
  - Explanation of tubal occlusion

- Once the candidate has taken a relevant history and presented to you, provide the candidate with the following information:

  - Laparoscopy was performed and showed Fitz-Hugh Curtis adhesions, the occluded tube was removed and the contralateral tube looked normal and could be preserved.

- Now ask the candidate to explain the most likely diagnosis of previous PID to Lauren.  
  Lauren is worried that the HSG has caused the adhesions, please address that.
  
- Record your overall clinical impression of the candidate for each domain (e.g., should this performance be pass, borderline, or a fail).
